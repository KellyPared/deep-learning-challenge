## About
The Alphabet Soup nonprofit foundation has provided funding to over 34,000 organizations over the years. However, not all organizations have been successful in their ventures. To select the applicants with the best chance of success in their ventures, Alphabet Soup needs a tool that can predict whether an applicant will be successful if funded by them.

In this project, I will use machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier that can predict the success of an organization if funded by Alphabet Soup. I will use various features from the provided dataset such as the application type, affiliated sector of industry, government organization classification, use case for funding, organization type, income classification, special considerations for application, funding amount requested, and active status of the organization.

## Dataset
The provided dataset contains metadata about over 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. It includes identification columns such as EIN and NAME, and columns that capture information about the organization's application type, affiliated sector of industry, government organization classification, use case for funding, organization type, income classification, special considerations for application, funding amount requested, and active status.

## Goal
My goal is to create a binary classifier that can predict whether an organization will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. To achieve this, I will use machine learning and neural networks to analyze the features in the dataset and predict the success of an organization.

## Methodology
I will use a combination of exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to develop the predictive model. I will use a binary classification algorithm to classify an organization as successful or not successful based on the features in the dataset.

## Conclusion
By creating a predictive model that can identify organizations with the best chance of success, Alphabet Soup can improve their funding selection process and increase the overall impact of their contributions.
